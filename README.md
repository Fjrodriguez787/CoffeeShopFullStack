# Coffee Shop

Users have the ability to log in as a Barista or a Cashier. On the Cashier side the user is choosing one beverage out of the given options but clicking on it. After the beverage is chosen the size is clicked, the name of the customer is typed into, and finally a submit button will send the order to the Barista. On the Barista end, the barista logs in using an email. Once logged in, there is a section for orders that need to be complete. Once they are completed you can send them off to another section that is labeled complete!
